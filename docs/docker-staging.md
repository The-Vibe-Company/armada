# Docker placement: coordinator one-prompt smoke (#1165)

API-only preview for a **private, plain-image Codex sandbox**. Machine lifecycle
is the dial-out host daemon; enrolment, health, prompt and journal are the existing
Armada runtime channel. No inbound host port, Docker socket in the sandbox, agent
host API, fake golden or Boat compatibility ID. Boat and Modal are unchanged.
This delivers the commands to test, not a claim that a worker ran real inference.
Workers never receive host SSH, staging credentials, deploy or apply migrations.

## Staging prerequisites (coordinator only)

Deploy the merged revision through the normal process, with its existing migrations
(including the already merged Docker schema/mailbox/bound-job and runtime fences).
No new migration is introduced by this increment. The normal server Docker build
already publishes the compiled runtime, Codex archive and manifests. Set explicitly:

```text
ARMADA_DOCKER_HOSTS=1
ARMADA_DOCKER_PLACEMENT=1
ARMADA_DOCKER_RUNTIME_MANIFEST=/opt/armada/runtime-manifests/x64.json
```

The supplied real host is Linux x64, Docker 29/runc, 32 CPUs. The manifest must be
from the **same deployed server build** as `/api/runtime/artifacts/<digest>`.
Other supported installations may choose the arm64 manifest on an arm64 host;
there is no scheduler/automatic architecture detection. Manifest/origin/architecture
are server deployment inputs, not request fields. The image must match that ABI and contain working HTTPS CA roots.
The smoke uses the official Debian-based [buildpack-deps curl image](https://github.com/docker-library/buildpack-deps/blob/master/debian/bookworm/curl/Dockerfile),
whose recipe explicitly installs ca-certificates; a bare Debian slim image lacks that guarantee.
The server needs its normal encryption key and model-account configuration.
Use an org-admin Armada bearer and an active Codex-compatible account ID/version
that bearer can use (user-owned or this org's). API key/custom endpoint and the
existing Codex subscription broker are reused; no provider credential is a model key.

Defaults pending later owner decisions: host credential has no expiry and is
revocable; default sandbox TTL is the existing four hours; no disk quota. Ordinary
owner-trusted Docker only. Goldens, resume, Hosts UI, gVisor and multi-tenancy are
not part of this preview. It deliberately admits **one distinct prompt per sandbox**;
retries reuse the same request UUID and input, never start a second turn.

## Exact commands: build/install, register on stdin, answer, stop/delete

Run these from a Linux coordinator checkout of the merged revision with Bun 1.4.2,
Python 3 and an existing SSH config entry for the test host. Do not use `set -x`.
The host account needs Docker CLI access (rootless where available); daemon access
is powerful even without root. No sudo or system-wide service install is required.
The commands install only under that account's `.local` directory.

```sh
set -euo pipefail
export DOCKER_SSH='YOUR_EXISTING_SSH_CONFIG_NAME'
export ARMADA_STAGING='https://armada-mcp-staging.up.railway.app'
export ARMADA_ORG='YOUR_STAGING_ORG_UUID'
export ARMADA_CREDENTIAL='YOUR_CODEX_ACCOUNT_UUID'
export ARMADA_CREDENTIAL_VERSION='1' # use its current version, not a guessed stale pin

bun build packages/docker-host/src/main.ts --compile --target=bun-linux-x64 --outfile dist/armada-docker-host
ssh -- "$DOCKER_SSH" 'docker version; docker info --format "{{json .Runtimes}}"; docker ps -a; docker image ls; docker volume ls'
ssh -- "$DOCKER_SSH" 'set -eu; umask 077; install -d -m 700 "$HOME/.local/bin"; test ! -e "$HOME/.local/state/armada-docker-smoke"; test ! -L "$HOME/.local/state/armada-docker-smoke"; test ! -e "$HOME/.local/bin/armada-docker-host"; test ! -L "$HOME/.local/bin/armada-docker-host"'

export DOCKER_IMAGE="$(ssh -- "$DOCKER_SSH" 'docker image inspect --format "{{index .RepoDigests 0}}" buildpack-deps:bookworm-curl')"
# This plain Debian-based image contains CA roots, but no Armada runtime or Codex.
read -r -s -p 'Staging org-admin Armada bearer: ' ARMADA_TOKEN; printf '\n'
export ARMADA_TOKEN
python3 scripts/smoke-docker-lifecycle.py \
  --server "$ARMADA_STAGING" --org "$ARMADA_ORG" \
  --credential "$ARMADA_CREDENTIAL" --credential-version "$ARMADA_CREDENTIAL_VERSION" \
  --ssh "$DOCKER_SSH" --image "$DOCKER_IMAGE"
unset ARMADA_TOKEN
```

Registration calls the existing org-admin token endpoint and pipes its one-use
capability directly into `armada-docker-host register --server <staging-origin>
--state-dir "$HOME/.local/state/armada-docker-smoke"` over SSH stdin. It never prints
the token, writes it locally or passes it in argv; the daemon's private state retains
only its exchanged host credential at 0600. The script removes `ARMADA_TOKEN` from
SSH's environment so SSH `SendEnv` cannot forward the user's API bearer to the host.
It starts the daemon detached with `nohup setsid`, saving a private PID/log beside
state. Do not register again if an exchange outcome is unknown: inspect that state
or use a fresh admin registration ticket as described in `docker-host-daemon.md`.

Expected script output: public `HOST_ID`, `SANDBOX_ID`, bootstrap/prompt/cleanup
request IDs, then `DOCKER_OK` with harness-reported input/output tokens and `PASS`.
The script waits for create ACK, issues one bootstrap, waits for epoch-bound Runner
health, enqueues one durable Codex prompt and reads the **acknowledged server journal**
until answer, finished status and token counters are present. Missing usage is
unknown, never estimated; it fails the smoke rather than inventing a count.
It then waits for stop and delete ACKs. Stages have a bounded ten-minute budget;
the daemon polls every 20 seconds and cold artifacts can take time. No CI polling.
After failure it attempts only this sandbox's stop/delete; offline/uncertain cleanup
stays unconfirmed, and printed IDs must be retained for reconciliation. Inspect the
private daemon log, not tokens or credential state. No readiness is inferred from
a host ACK or an HTTP enqueue response. Cost may remain unknown in this preview.

Run with `--host-id <printed-HOST_ID>` to reuse a host that is already registered
and running. That skips registration/startup, but allocates a new one-prompt sandbox.
Do not do this to retry an unknown launch: first reconcile the original printed
sandbox/request IDs. A successful smoke removes its sandbox/container/workspace
volume, **not** the host registration, daemon or shared pulled image.

## HTTP contract / reconciliation

Bearer-only POST JSON under `/api/v1/docker/sandboxes/`; no browser Origin/cookie
authority. Every body has `org`; all except launch have `sandboxId`.

| Operation | Additional fields | Expected result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `launch` | `requestId`, `hostId`, digest-pinned `image`, `credentialId`, `credentialVersion`; optional `ttlSeconds`, `model`, `reasoningEffort` | 201 private Docker record, initially starting; requestId is sandbox/create ID |
| `bootstrap` | `requestId` | 202 original bound bootstrap phase; call only after create job completes |
| `ready` | `requestId` | 202 pending, or 200 ready after real same-epoch health |
| `prompt` | `requestId`, `text` | 202 pending, or 200 admitted with native receipt; same UUID/text reconciles |
| `journal` | optional numeric sequence `cursor`, `limit` 1..100 | 200 events with sequence, cursor, hasMore and saved usage |
| `get` | none | 200 safe retained metadata/status |
| `stop`, `delete` | `requestId` | 202 machine job; delete requires confirmed stopped/failed/deleted state |
| `job` | `requestId` | pending/completed/failed state, or null if absent |

Keep stable UUIDs for launch/bootstrap/health/prompt/cleanup retries. Never generate
replacement operations for an unknown result. Bootstrap retries cannot rotate a
consumed/live ticket; deployment changes are not upgrades to an admitted operation.
`ARMADA_DOCKER_PLACEMENT=0` disables new launch/bootstrap/readiness/prompt; keep
`ARMADA_DOCKER_HOSTS=1` for retained metadata/journal, cleanup and daemon polling.
Removing the host flag unmounts both Docker API families; other providers are unaffected.

## Host inspection and uninstall (coordinator only)

After ACKed deletion, compare inventories with the recorded baseline. The owned
container and volume for `SANDBOX_ID` must be absent; unrelated workloads/data
unchanged. All created Docker resources carry `dev.armada.machine.*` labels.
There is no global prune, shared image removal or automatic purge of host files.
To uninstall, first confirm every retained sandbox for this host is deleted; then
revoke `POST /api/v1/docker/hosts/revoke` with `{"org":"<org>","hostId":"<HOST_ID>"}`
using normal private bearer delivery. Verify the saved PID belongs to the exact
installed `armada-docker-host run --state-dir ...armada-docker-smoke` process before
sending SIGTERM; wait for it to exit (up to a poll period). Only then remove that
private smoke state directory and `.local/bin/armada-docker-host`. Do not remove
a pre-existing binary/state or a shared pulled image. No uninstall CLI is claimed.

## Exact local coordinator check

```sh
bun test packages/mcp-server/test/docker-runtime-lifecycle.test.ts packages/mcp-server/test/docker-sandbox-routes.test.ts packages/docker-host/test packages/core/test/docker-machine.test.ts
```

Migrated SQL plus fake host facts/Docker CLI protect dispatch, admission, durable
retries, real runtime command/enrolment/journal protocol, token projection and
stop/delete facts. No test network or wall-clock waits; no required CI job/budget
added. The real-host commands above are the coordinator's external acceptance.
